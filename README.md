MaxStack is almost like a stack.  
The basic difference is that besides providing the fundamental operations of Stack, it also provides the max( ) function to get the max element in the stack


## <u>Implementation-1:</u>
[Code Link](./max_stack1.cpp)

1. push -> O(1) time and O(1) space
1. pop -> O(n) time and O(1) space
1. max -> O(1) time and O(1) space
